# BuildingBloCS Database Workshop 2024

In this workshop, weâ€™ll explore the fundamentals of databases using SQLite, practice SQL commands, and integrate SQLite into Python.

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- [x] Understand basic SQL commands (CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
- [x] Use SQLite to build and manage a database
- [x] Integrate SQLite into a Python program using `sqlite3`
- [x] Use DB Browser to visualize and manipulate databases

## Getting ready

Make sure you:

- Install **DB Browser** and **VSCode**.
- Have **Python 3.x** ready.

To download the sample **CSV files** and the notebook, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buildingblocs/database-workshop-2024.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file by clicking on the green **Code** button above.

## Downloading

You will need to download DB Browser. DB Browser is a GUI tool for working with SQLite databases. It allows you to create, view, and manage databases with ease.

You will also need to download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for working with Python and SQLite.

ðŸ‘‰ [**Download DB Browser here**](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)  
ðŸ‘‰ [**Download VS Code here**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Setting up

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. ðŸ‘‰ [**Download Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then, run the following command to check if Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

SQLite is bundled with Python, so no additional installation is required!

### Happy coding! ðŸŽ…

If you have any questions during the workshop, donâ€™t hesitate to ask our facilitators.
